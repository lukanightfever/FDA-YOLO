===
The dataset can be downloaded from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NaTZuoIslkxCGQQTKQsQRA?pwd=yndg<br>
The format of the labels can be describe as: <br>
`cls, x/img_w, y/img_h, w/img_w, h/imgh, theta`<br>
`cls` means the ID of the category. `theta` denotes the rotation angle of the bounding box and `[x, y, w, h, theta]` is the bounding box of the target. `img_w` and `img_h` are width and height of the image.
